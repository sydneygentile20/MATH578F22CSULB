    "## Course Description\n",
    "\n",
    "In this class, we will focus on solving numerical linear algebra problem related to real world applications. We will learn to use Python and Jupyter Notebooks in a **top-down** approach. That means, we will start using some \"black boxes\" or matrix decompositions that haven't yet been explained, and then we'll dig into the lower level details later. The following topics may be covered through this course:\n",
    "* Modeling with NMF and SVD\n",
    "* Background Removal with Robust PCA\n",
    "* Compressed Sensing for CT scans with Robust Regression\n",
    "* Predicting Health Outcomes with Linear Regression\n",
    "* PageRank with Eigen Decompositions\n",
    "* QR Factorization\n",
    "* Iterative Methods for Sparse Systems\n",
    "\n",
    "## Student Learning Outcomes\n",
    "\n",
    "Upon the completion of the course, you will be able to \n",
    "1. install various python modules and look up useful functions through documentations;\n",
    "2. use python to solve some numerical linear algebra problems;\n",
    "3. use python to load, process, learn and interpret various data;\n",
    "4. apply various factorization techniques to real world applications such as image processing, page rank, literature classification, etc;\n",
    "5. write python code to implement iterative algorithms for solving large sparse systems, such as GMRES, CG, etc;\n",
    "6. use Jypiter-note book to write technical reports and manuscripts, explaining numerical linear algebra topics in a way that combines theory and coding;\n",
    "7. clearly communicate numerical linear algebra topics and their applications through oral presentations. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Textbook\n",

    "### Accommodation and Technical Help:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. If you have disability and need some special accommodation, you need to visit Bob Murphy Access Center (BMAC) [https://web.csulb.edu/divisions/students/dss/](https://web.csulb.edu/divisions/students/dss/). It is your responsibility to notify me, in advance, of your need for the accommodation of a disability that has been verified by the University.\n",
    "2. If you do not have a laptop or only have poor internet access, you may check out CSULB’s announce- ment regarding supplying you with laptops and internet hotspots. Please see the webpage linked here: [https://www.csulb.edu/news/article/csulb-to-supply-laptops-and-internet-hotspots-for-students? fbclid=IwAR3Kd8A1UpGn80XI1ZscYl9SCLCF4IY-D4CSwAosfRx8iJanAMtDoBEgLCo](https://www.csulb.edu/news/article/csulb-to-supply-laptops-and-internet-hotspots-for-students?fbclid=IwAR3Kd8A1UpGn80XI1ZscYl9SCLCF4IY-D4CSwAosfRx8iJanAMtDoBEgLCo).\n",
    "3. If you need help on Beachboard, Zoom, or other technical area related to online learning, you may seek help from Academic Technology Services. Here is their website: [https://www.csulb.edu/academic-technology-services](https://www.csulb.edu/academic-technology-services). You may find the Keep Learning module in this website helpful.

    "### Dropping or Withdrawal:\n",
    "\n",
    "If you intend to drop (within first two weeks) or withdraw (week 3-12) from the class, you may follow the guideline in this website [https://www.csulb.edu/student-records/dropping-and-withdrawing](https://www.csulb.edu/student-records/dropping-and-withdrawing). It is your responsibility to withdraw officially from classes. Instructors have no obligation to withdraw students who do not attend courses, and may choose not to do so. You should also consult the CSULB Enrollment Services website for registration information: [http://www.csulb.edu/depts/enrollment/summer/calendar.html](http://www.csulb.edu/depts/enrollment/summer/calendar.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Attendance and Missed Assignments:\n",
    "\n",
    "Students are required to attend every class. However, attendance and participation will not be used in grade determination. It is the student’s responsibility to keep informed of any announcements, syllabus adjustments, or policy changes made during scheduled classes. If you miss the deadline of one due material, you may make it up or turn it in late, but you need to provide legitimate reasons. Otherwise, the instructor may not accept the late material or may deduct partial credits.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cheating and Plagiarism:\n",
    "\n",
    "Although students are encouraged to work together on the lab assignments, the work you turn in must be products of your own intellectual activity. The quizzes are all open book, open notes, but you may not ask someone to do the work for you, and you are not allowed to discuss with each other solutions to quiz problems. Cheating and plagiarism are serious academic offenses. Please read the section on cheating and plagiarism in the CSULB Catalog.
