    "Our webpage for this class is in github. Git is a version control software, when developers develop software packages, they always need to keep track of and switch back and forth from different versions, especially when they work in teams. Github is a user-friendly website that combines Git with some other programming languages. In this class, we use Github to combine Python with Git. In your local computer, you may use a software called *Github desktop* for accessing the course content. \n",

It's possible that you need to uncomment a line in that file in order to install a supporting package. \n",
